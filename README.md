# Graph Simulation Visualizer

Graph Simulation Visualizer is an interactive web application for visualizing and learning fundamental graph algorithms. It provides step-by-step, animated explanations of algorithms like Dijkstra's shortest path, Breadth-First Search (BFS), Depth-First Search (DFS), and Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) algorithms (Prim's and Kruskal's). This tool is ideal for students, educators, and anyone interested in understanding how graph algorithms work in a visual and intuitive way.
